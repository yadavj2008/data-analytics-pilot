# README: This will create a GCP Project named "Terraform" and a service account named "sa-terraform".
#         The service account will be passed to the Docker Container as its credentials
#         KEEP the export JSON safe (or delete immediately)
#
#         NOTE: If you are an internal Google user you need to go to your environment management  
#               panel and click the down arrow and select "Request Billing Roles".  Paste in the 
#               name of your service account created below and select all the roles.
# 
# You need to run this script before using the below scripts:
# - deploy-use-docker.sh
# - deploy-use-existing-project-docker
# - deploy-use-existing-project.sh
