Use Cases:
    - Materialized views can increase your performance on aggreation queries or simply re-cluster your data based upon how your
      users are using your tables.  Materialized views can be implemented without having to go back and update all your SQL
      statements to point to the materialized view.  
    - Materialized views can be used to re-clusters data 

Description: 
    - Show how to use a materialize view to increase performance
    - Show how your existing queries can be automatically rewritten to utilize a materialize view

Reference:
    - https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/materialized-views

Clean up / Reset script:
    DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS `{{ params.project_id }}.{{ params.dataset_id }}.mv_taxi_tips_totals`;
    DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS `{{ params.project_id }}.{{ params.dataset_id }}.mv_taxi_trips_by_location`;
